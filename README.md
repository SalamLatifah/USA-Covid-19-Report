## **Project Title:**  
**COVID-19 Analysis in the USA**

---

## **Project Description:**  
This project offers a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19's effects on hospital capacity and patient load across various regions in the United States. It examines hospital bed utilization, ICU occupancy, and COVID-19 hospitalization trends, enabling users to compare different regions, types of hospitals, and key metrics. The insights derived from this data highlight the regions and hospital types that experienced the most significant strain, providing valuable information for future planning and resource allocation.

## **Technologies Used:**  
- **Power BI:** For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Used within Power BI to create custom measures and calculations.
- **Data Source:** COVID-19 Hospital Capacity dataset (CSV format).
- **Optional Tools:** Excel (for initial data cleaning or transformation), Python/R (if further data manipulation is required outside of Power BI).

## **Installation Instructions:**  
1. **Power BI Desktop**: Install Power BI Desktop if not already installed. It can be downloaded from [here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).
2. **Data Download**: Obtain the dataset file containing COVID-19 hospital data. Make sure it is in the correct format (CSV).
3. **Import Data**: Load the dataset into Power BI using the "Get Data" option and select "CSV."
4. **Custom Measures**: Create DAX measures as explained in the project for calculating bed usage, ICU occupancy rates, and COVID-19 hospitalizations.

## **Usage Instructions:**  
1. **Explore Visualizations**: Open the Power BI file (PBIX) and interact with the visualizations. Users can analyze COVID-19 hospitalizations, bed usage, and ICU occupancy across different regions and hospital types.
2. **Filter by Region**: Use the slicers to filter the analysis by region, state, or hospital subtype.
3. **Compare Hospitals**: Use the comparison tables and bar charts to see how different hospitals performed during the pandemic, and identify the most impacted regions or hospital types.
4. **Key Metrics**:
   - Total inpatient beds used for COVID-19 patients.
   - ICU occupancy percentage.
   - Adult and pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations.
